# Nevo's Map Anonymizer
This is a thing to replace the creator of a map with their userID to make it anonymous, it also strips away the GD's names (mostly). The reason for this is to remove the bias from when I'm checking maps so I give everyone a fair chance. (I'm a horrible person)

## Usage

1. **Put links into urls.txt**: One per line the program will download and make the edits.
2. **Run the Script**: python main.py
3. **Output**: The modified .osz files will be stored in a folder named `Maps`.
